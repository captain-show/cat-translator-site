    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What does Cat Translator actually do?</summary>
      <p>Cat Translator analyzes feline vocalizations and translates them into human-readable messages, helping cat owners better understand their pet's needs, moods, and personality quirks.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can this app really understand my cat?</summary>
      <p>While it doesn't decode feline language with 100% accuracy (they're mysterious creatures, after all!), it uses behavioral and acoustic data to offer the most likely interpretations based on tone, pitch, and context.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Does it work with kittens or older cats?</summary>
      <p>Yes! The app works across age groups. Kittens may have higher-pitched meows, while older cats may be quieter or more expressive in body language — Cat Translator adapts to both.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I record my cat's meow?</summary>
      <p>Just tap the "record" button while your cat vocalizes, and the app will capture the sound, analyze its pattern, and deliver a translation within seconds.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can it translate purring or growling?</summary>
      <p>Yes! Purring may indicate comfort or excitement, while growling usually signals annoyance or fear. The app offers interpretations for a variety of sound types beyond basic meows.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Does it require internet access?</summary>
      <p>Most core features work offline, but advanced analysis and updates (like new vocal samples) may require a connection.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is it safe for my cat?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely! Cat Translator only listens passively — it doesn't emit any sounds or signals. Just make sure your feline friend isn't trying to chew your phone out of curiosity!</p>
